# CosmWasm Development Environment Setup Guide

Welcome to the CosmWasm Development Environment Setup Guide. This guide will help you set up your Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu is used in this article) for CosmWasm smart contract development. CosmWasm is a smart contract platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem, allowing developers to write secure and efficient smart contracts in Rust. Before we begin, please check out this article for a basic understanding of CosmWasm.

## Prerequisites
Before we start setting up the development environment, please make sure you have the following:

A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu is used in this article)
Basic understanding of Bash scripting and the command line

## Setting up the Development Environment
### 1. Install Rust
CosmWasm is built using Rust programming language. We need to install Rust to start development. You can use the following command to install Rust:

arduino
Copy code
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
This command will install Rustup, which is the Rust toolchain manager. Rustup is used to install and manage different versions of Rust.

After installation, check if Rust is installed properly using the following command:


rustc --version
### 2. Install Additional Tools
CosmWasm uses additional tools for building and deploying smart contracts. You need to install the following tools:

make: It is a build automation tool that is used to simplify building CosmWasm smart contracts.
You can install these tools using the following command:


sudo apt-get install make

### 3. Install CosmWasm SDK
Now, we need to install the CosmWasm SDK. You can install it using the following command:


cargo install cosmwasm-cli --version=1.0.0-rc1 --locked
This command will install the CosmWasm CLI tool, which is used for creating, building, and testing CosmWasm smart contracts.

After installation, check if the CosmWasm CLI tool is installed properly using the following command:


cosmwasm --version
Congratulations! You have successfully set up your development environment for CosmWasm smart contract development.
